## Electron + Webservice Coding Test
**Web service:** a very simple webservice that exposes crud functionality for device. Write to object holding records of devices model.

**Device Model:** Device ID, Name, IP address and architecture are the fields.

**Electron app:** Must have pages for Listing devices and crud functionality for each device… obviously the app must consume the web service.

**Guidelines/Notes:**

· The webservice and app must be written using typescript

· The test can be delivered in one or two Git repositories, it must be easy and straightforward to run both the webservice and apps using npm commands… ie npm run start or similar.

## To Run

 1. Clone this repository
 2. Run `npm run install-all` from project directory
 3. Then run `npm start`
